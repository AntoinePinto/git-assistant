## Project Description
This Git Assistant project aims to provide assistance with Git operations and generate a README file for a GitHub repository using Streamlit library and various scripts. The project contains several files and scripts, each with a specific purpose. The `git_assistant.py` script is the main script that creates a web application using Streamlit library, which interacts with a Git repository. It has two main functionalities: generating a README file for the repository and providing a question-and-answer interface for users to ask about the repository. The `git_assistant` tool helps users generate a README file for their GitHub repository using generative AI, and the `git_utils.py` defines a Git assistant class that can perform various tasks related to Git repositories. The `llm.py` file contains a Python class called "ChatGPT" that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user messages, while the `streamlit_utils.py` provides various functions for configuring the appearance of a Streamlit web application and interacting with the OpenAI API. 

## Installation
To run the Git Assistant project, it is necessary to have several dependencies installed. These dependencies can be installed by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory. The required dependencies include numpy, openai, streamlit, pillow, and easyenvi, among others. 

## Usage
### Cloning a Git Repository
The Git Assistant project can be used to clone a Git repository. The user inputs the URL of the repository, and the script uses the Git assistant module to clone the repository. The `git_assistant.py` script has a `clone_repository` method that clones the Git repository specified by the `repo_url` argument if it does not already exist in the `folder` directory.

### Retrieving Content of Repository Files
The Git Assistant project can retrieve the content of all files in a specified folder, excluding certain files such as those in the `.git` folder or those with "README" in their name. The content of the files is stored in a dictionary with the file path as the key and the file content as the value. The `rsc/scripts/utils.py` script can be used to perform this functionality.

### Generating File Summaries
The Git Assistant project can generate summaries for each file in the repository and a global summary for the repository. The `git_utils.py` file defines a `git_assistant` class that provides methods to generate summaries for each file and a global summary for the repository. The method stores the file summaries in the `files` dictionary under the `summary` key. The `max_token`, `min_len_summary`, `context`, and `prompt_template` arguments are used to configure the AI language model to generate the summaries. The `max_token` argument specifies the maximum number of tokens to use when generating each summary. The `min_len_summary` argument specifies the minimum length of each summary in characters. The `context` argument specifies the context in which the AI language model should generate the summaries. The `prompt_template` argument specifies the prompt to use when generating each summary.

### Generating a Global Summary
The `git_utils.py` file also defines a `get_global_summary` method that generates a global summary for the repository. The `context` and `prompt_template` arguments are used to configure the AI language model to generate the summary.

### Transforming Structure into Markdown Format
The `rsc/scripts/utils.py` file contains a function that can transform a given structure into a markdown format.

### Generating README File Content
The `git_assistant.py` script can be used to generate a README structure and content based on the summaries generated by the `git_utils.py` file. The user can then generate a README structure and content based on this summary. The README can be displayed as either Markdown output or Markdown code.
